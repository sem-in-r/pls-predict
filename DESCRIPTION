Description: This package provides multiple tools for performing predictions on SEMinR PLS models. Predictions can be 
    generated for SEMinR models. Cross-validation predictions using either k-fold or LOOCV can be generated. Predictions Intervals
    can be generated for test data. Predictive metrics are generated for both items and constructs. The composite accuracy and validity
    can be evaluated demonstrating predictive power and overfit, highlighting cases not well predicted by the model.
